# Online-Food-Ordering-Website

  This project is inspired from this idea and hopes to fulfil the requirements by 
developing a website prototype capable of managing food order from the sides of the 
customers, admin and the delivery person. The main highlight of the project is its database 
functionality. This food ordering website will be able to attract more customers by having a 
user-friendly Interface and a strong database. The website makes use of a powerful tech stack 
containing HTML, CSS, Java Script, PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap for efficient querying and 
user-friendly themes. The outcome of the project will throw light on the fact that database 
functionality of a website is necessary for its seamless performance.
